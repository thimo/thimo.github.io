Last month I did a presentation called "On REST and Beans" on the Dutch <a href="http://www.xpagesandbeer.nl/">XPages & Beer</a> event. It was my first ever presentation on a technical subject and I felt quite a bit of tension beforehand. But the presentation went well and I got some very nice, positive feedback. That convinced me to submit an abstract, on the same subject, for BLUG. Fingers crossed!

The slides are in Dutch. If my abstract for <a href="http://www.blug.be/">BLUG</a> gets accepted, I'll make an English version.
