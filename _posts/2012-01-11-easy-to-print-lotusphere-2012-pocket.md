It's a really nice reference, but the PDF is a bit of a challenge to print on A4 or Paper.

Last night I had some fun with combining and rotating the pages to get an easily printable PDF and here I share them with you (hoping IBM doesn't mind).

There are two versions (update: now three):

- Printed onto A4, with <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/67849/LS12_PocketAgenda_A4print.pdf">4 pages combined per page</a>. These require eagle eyes or reading glasses

- <strike>One that's printed onto A5 with <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/67849/LS12_PocketAgenda_A5print.pdf">2 pages combined per page</a>. It will come out nicely readable if you select "fit to printable area" when printing to A4/Paper.</strike>

- Same as the A5 version with <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/67849/LS12_PocketAgenda_A4print_big.pdf">2 pages combined per page</a>, but on A4 format and rotated for easier viewing on a computer/tablet.

All versions lack the frontpage, that was needed to get all pages to align correctly.

I hope these can be of help to you. Have fun and see you in Orlando!

Update 11-1-2012 12:10 CET:
Added a third version. It's the same as the second, but now in A4 size and rotated for easier viewing.
